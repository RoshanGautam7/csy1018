				<h2> Introduction</h2>
				<p> I am computer student and I was interested in developing applications so I joined this college. I was totally unknown about creating a website and had very little idea about creating it. I started doing research and started getting familiar to create a webpage and I started loving it as well. I also took help from my friends and started creating a webpage and finally designed one. I faced a lot of issues while creating a webpage. Before I used to push a lot in github but due to some issues my files were not uploaded on github which I realized after few weeks while I was checking my github. It was very difficult and I was not able to push a lot in github due to this issue which I later consulted with my teacher and started uploading files on github. Another problem was creating a hamburger menu without using absolute positioning because using absolute positioning would turn out to be a failure grade. I faced a lot of problems but I kept on figuring it out and correcting my mistake. I am still not so good at creating website but now I have idea on how to create website. </p>

				<h2> Design of my webpage:</h2>
				<p>
					I created webpage using tags that I have learned in my classroom and I came to create a good webpage which is quite attractive as well. I followed all the restrictions properly and I was totally not sure about what to do. I was confused at first because there were lots of restrictions. I was not familiar to these sorts of projects and I was not sure exactly how to design it. Slowly I started getting ideas and started doing my tasks.I planned a design in my mind and started working on the design and searched alot of way ti create it I mostly used youtube videos help .

					<h2>Discussion of module </h2>
					<p>
						To be honest I have been enjoying reading this module CSY1018. I used to love designing wesites since my +2 and I love to create websites but due to some time gap I completely lost the ideas and forgot all the codes and process that I have learned during my +2 examination and recalling it was very tought but somehow I managed these things. I am still learning this module and I wanna enroll myself for the better side and I want to be perfect in this module. Due to this pandemic situation we are not able to attend physical classes so online class are not as effective as physical class.
